_This feature is only available with a paid landgrid.com account of Team or higher. [Click here to upgrade your account](https://landgrid.com/plans)._

If you signed up for a Team account, you'll have chosen how many seats you are able to have in your group (you can always add or remove the number of seats from your Billing page). Enterprise customers can invite an unlimited number of people to their account.

Navigate to "Members", found under your group's dropdown menu in the top left corner. Click the "Invite a Member" button on the top right hand side of the page, then choose their permissions level and enter their email. If you need help setting permissions levels for new members, you can read about that in [User Permissions](https://support.landgrid.com/articles/user-permissions/).

If you've done the above and the intended recipient for some reason can't find the invite email, you can always click the cog icon, then 'Get invite link': you can then send them this link directly in an email thread you may already have going (and hence, know they should be able to find more easily).

To **uninvite** a collaborator, simply click on the "Remove from Group" button, found to the right of the users' name.
