_This feature is only available with a paid landgrid.com account of Team or higher. [Click here to upgrade your account](https://landgrid.com/plans)._

If you signed up for a Team account, you'll have chosen how many seats you are able to have in your group (you can always add or remove the number of seats from your Billing page). Enterprise customers can invite an unlimited number of people to their account.

Navigate to "Members", found under your group's dropdown menu in the top left corner. Click the "Invite a Member" button on the right hand side of the page. If you need help setting permissions levels for new members, you can read about that in [User Permissions](https://support.landgrid.com/articles/user-permissions/).




To **uninvite** a collaborator, simply click on the "Remove from Group" button, found to the right of the users' name.
