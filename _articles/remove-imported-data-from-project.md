If you have data in your landgrid.com account which you no longer need or want to work with, you can remove it by going to the "Datasets" tab of your landgrid.com account (click "My Profile" under your username at the top right of your screen, then "Datasets"). Navigate to the dataset you want to delete, click "Edit" and at the bottom select "Delete".
