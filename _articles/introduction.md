### Welcome to the Landgrid Mapping Platform!

**Overview**

Landgrid Pro is your personal platform for working with property information. With landgrid.com, you can import property data, create multiple projects, build custom property surveys, invite collaborators, conduct customizable surveys in the field with your mobile device, and map your survey results as they come streaming into your account in real-time.

**Note: Pro accounts are designed to be single-user. To this end, you'll find that you can only log in to your Pro account on two devices at a time. If you'd like to work with friends or colleagues on a project, please consider signing up for our Team plan, where you can choose the number of collaborators in your group.**

Our maps are easy to style, share, and embed, so you can create beautiful interactive web maps without writing a single line of code. User-friendly tools like our data list view and our query builder help make complicated information digestible, so you can make well-informed planning and land use decisions while spending less time wrestling with parcel data. You may be interested in viewing our [tutorial videos](https://landgrid.com/pages/tutorial-videos) as you get started, which provide more detail in a visual format.
